<p>When I started to use Vim I needed a fast way to go between files by hitting Ctrl+P and typing the file name just like in Sublime Text, Text Mate or any other text editor. Then I found <a href="https://github.com/ctrlpvim/ctrlp.vim">ctrlp</a> plugin for vim which was ok. The main problem I had with ctrlp was speed. At my full time job I am working with a code base that contains 20,000+ files and it was very frustrating every-time I had to go to a file.  Even the caching did not help much. And some of the time the search result it returned was not matching the file (most probably due to very similar file naming).</p>
<p>After some search for its alternative I came across  <a href="https://github.com/wincent/command-t">Command-T</a> and it was built for speed (much faster than CtrlP). And the search result was much accurate. I was happy with it for a long time but I had one problem with it as it would not work with  <a href="https://neovim.io/">neovim</a>. But I really wanted to switch to neovim and using CtrlP was out of question for me.</p>

<p>Then I found <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf">fzf</a> which would work in <a href="https://neovim.io/">neovim</a>. It was amazingly faster than <a href="https://github.com/wincent/command-t">Command-T</a> as well. I heard of this quiet a while ago but did not tried it. This was really a holy experience for me haha, it blew away all fuzzy finder. In Github  page it says "<em>fzf is a general-purpose command-line fuzzy finder.</em>" so it can be used from command-line as well. Actually this plugin is rewritten in <a href="https://golang.org/">Golang</a> which might be the reason of its speed.</p>
